    <b>Kate Jones / VP / Volunteer Coordinator</b>
    <br><br>
    (Kate not in attendance - update sent in via Notes to Board)
    <br><br>
    1,100 copies of the Volunteer Form were given to the school to go home with the New School Year packet.  They are on blue paper.  The plan re: volunteers this year is to gather as many names as possible up front (as we have in the past) but also sent out blasts on Sign Up Genius before events to encourage more community participation.  There is an account with Sign Up Genius and CMS can create event sign-ups that can be blasted out to the masses (hopefully in the weekly blasts when needed.)  Kate will be going into the school frequently to pick up the volunteer forms that are returned to the school then ask those who responded if they wish to chair the committees.
    Website Update: The web domain is being purchased and the website should be ready to launch by Back-to-School night.  Information has been gathered from the school and some calendar info from the school and county websites to begin with.  Photos have been taken for the site and Kate met with Mr. R to find out about clubs and contacts.  Mr. R indicated that he wasn't sure what kind of participation we would get from teachers at the club expo and Kate suggested that if teachers can't be present, perhaps they could get a couple 8th graders that have been in the club for a couple years to "man" the table, hand out info, answer questions, and tell folks who to contact and the deadline to join the club"
