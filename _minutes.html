    <b>Treasurer’s Report / Laurie Rostock</b>
    <br><br>
    Budget is in good standing.  Changes in budget: Membership income calculated at $4.75. To be confirmed
    at National PTA. There are 263 members. BTSD +$278
    <br><br>
    <b>Membership / Vicki Louckes & Amy Richardson</b>
    Vicki & Amy were not in attendance- update sent in via Notes to Board)
    <br><br>
    Total Members                  263 (includes the 8 Amy has reported this evening)
    <br>
    Teacher Members                22 (included in total above)
    <br>
    Total Membership Fees          $3,655.00
    <br>
    Total Donations                $1,590.00
    <br>
    Total Revenue                  $5,235.00
    <br>
    This compares to the total 2012-13 membership of 296 with $1,942.00 in donations.  To compare similar
    timeframes, we had 289 members at the end of October 2013 and $1,852 in donations.
    <br>
    Central Middle School Facebook Page is up and running.  If you have not “liked” it yet please do.  This
    should be come a great tool for communication and volunteer recruiting.  We can grow the page
    participation by sending invites to our blast email list.  Current administrators are Ann-Marie, Kate
    and Vicki.  Denise has the ability to post but cannot manage the administrators at this time.
    <br>
    For Credit Card acceptance for donations and membership via website, Costs from several sources have
    been compared, the PTSA’s current banking provider, PayPal and two groups that serve the PTA community
    exclusively.  Given that we have sporadic usage it is in our best interest to use a service with zero
    monthly and/or minimum fees.  Both PayPal and Paperless PTO meet the criteria at similar cost.  Given
    most people’s familiarity with PayPal and the service’s ability to process transactions using both
    PayPal and Visa/MasterCard, Vicki recommends PayPal as the appropriate solution.  If our transaction
    volume and frequency grows significantly we can consider a more traditional provider.
    <br><br>
    <b>Hospitality / Denise Lundberg</b>
    <br><br>

Paypal option to submit an e-mail address for Blast updates. A button also needs to be added Donations to

                (Kate not in attendance - update sent in via Notes to Board)
                <br><br>
                1,100 copies of the Volunteer Form were given to the school to go home with the New School Year packet.
                They are on blue paper. The plan re: volunteers this year is to gather as many names as possible up
                front (as we have in the past) but also sent out blasts on Sign Up Genius before events to encourage
                more community participation. There is an account with Sign Up Genius and CMS can create event sign-ups
                that can be blasted out to the masses (hopefully in the weekly blasts when needed.) Kate will be going
                into the school frequently to pick up the volunteer forms that are returned to the school then ask those
                who responded if they wish to chair the committees.
                Website Update: The web domain is being purchased and the website should be ready to launch by
                Back-to-School night. Information has been gathered from the school and some calendar info from the
                school and county websites to begin with. Photos have been taken for the site and Kate met with Mr. R to
                find out about clubs and contacts. Mr. R indicated that he wasn't sure what kind of participation we
                would get from teachers at the club expo and Kate suggested that if teachers can't be present, perhaps
                they could get a couple 8th graders that have been in the club for a couple years to "man" the table,
                hand out info, answer questions, and tell folks who to contact and the deadline to join the club"

                <b>Principal's Report / Mrs. Beall</b>
                <br><br>
                SMART Boards & Technology is currently being installed and will be done by 1st day of school.
                School is fully staffed. Mrs. Arida has been promoted to Teacher Specialist in AVID. They currently have

                Schedules are all done.
                There are approximately 1060 students this year with 332 of them being 6th graders.
                The new Assistant Prinicpal is Courtney Roser ( croser@aacps.org).
                Mrs. Beall recommends putting the monthly calendar in the Blast for parents.
                <br><br>
                Mrs. Beall is currently working on the Technology Fundraiser. A letter will go out with all students
                asking for parent donations stating goal of how many laptops to purchase in the school year. Kate Jones
                is assisting with the fund raiser.
